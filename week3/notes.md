# Notes for week 3 of the web dev course: Requirements Engineering for web development

## Interaction with the client (Tipps)
+ Most clients have no idea what they want!
    - Your job to find out what he really wants

+ A good idea is to bring website examples of similar buisnessed to have a reference for your client

+ Be careful - most client try to put as much information about their buisness as they could on the page. But this is not useful for a website visitor 
    - ***Less information IS MORE***
    - Encourage the client that too much information might be overwhelming to a site visitor

+ Find a way for the client to INVEST in the project
    - Especially, if the project is done for free
    - The client should have some skin in the game (besides you) as well, to make the project valuable for him as well. If you do not do this, your website project might be just a side project for your client that he is not paying to much attention to!
    - Not much money investment, but at least a little

+ Have one person to make decisions for the project at the client side
    - If more then one decider is there, a lot of time will be there for discussions
    - Only one final decider needs to be there who will commit to decisions

+ Limit the number of revisions UPFRONT
    - To make sure it won't be a never ending project for you
    - Ideally you define a contract before you start
    - If your do a payed project, do not limit the number of revisions, ***BUT*** define the number of free revisions
    - E.g. 3 Time free revisions

+ Involve others if needed
    - Look out for young graphic designers or photographers in your surrounding area that might do the needed jobs for free, as long as they get mentioned in the project (To let them build up their portfolio as well)
    - Let the client do something to get him to have some skin in the game

+ Get an idea of what the client has right now

### Visit the client
+ Ask customers of the client if possible
+ Something to improve for the buisness?
+ Show of examples
    - Ask what is good / bad about the examples
+ Make the additional services (like photographer, graphic designer, ...) part of your service --> You can get payed even more

## Design overview
+ Make some quick markups --> ***DO NOT CODE DIRECTLY***
    - There is some software that lets you do markups and gives you basically HTML structured code back
    - Define a markup for all targeted layouts (i.e. Desktop, Tablet and Mobile)
    - Present the markup the client ***BEFORE*** you start coding the website!
+ Maybe you want to outsource this to a graphic designer!
+ Example Software: Balsamiq Mockups
    - Balsamic is the industry standart (NOT Free)
    - Pencil Evolus is a free tool that is avalable in Ubuntu https://pencil.evolus.vn/
+ Use dummy pictures within the mockup
+ Make mockups for all the pages, not just the landing page!
+ After a first Iteration, you can give the mockups again to the graphics designer and let him do the mockups with images and colors again
    - This is the basic design for starting off coding

# Basic Setup for a new website project
1.: Setting up the background color of the
2.: Choosing a font size for all pages.
    - You can import fonts from google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
    - This is just one line in you HTML document header part and one rule for the body in your CSS file. 
        - Go to a font style and click on the example sentence. Then click on the "Select this style" button to get the link and the CSS rule. 

# Using Bootstap
+ Example Implementations are under Components:
